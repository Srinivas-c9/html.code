        <h2>1945</h2>
    <p>Vannevar Bush writes 
        <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">an article </a>
        in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called
         a Memex, for memory extension,
         which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
         <h2>1965</h2>
    <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing,
         email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/library.html">Bootstrap Institute library.</a>

        Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing,
         and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York, <a href="https://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965.

           A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.
        
        Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
        <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, 
        "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes.
         Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran 
        on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See:<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/scaled/">Enquire user manualas scanned images</a>
